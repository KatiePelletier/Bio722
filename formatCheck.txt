###2. Initial Quality Control 

***

The files were transferred to the McMaster/Golding lab server from Ianâ€™s
storage space at MSU. The first step following transfer is to ensure
that this happened correctly using an md5sum check.

```
md5sum - c md5.txt
```

Flags; "-c" = report if checksums match contents of files (OK).
